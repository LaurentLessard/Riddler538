    "The New York Times recently launched some new word puzzles, one of which is [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee). In this game, seven letters are arranged in a honeycomb lattice, with one letter in the center. Here’s the lattice from December 24, 2019:\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify as many words that meet the following criteria:\n",
    "- The word must be at least four letters long.\n",
    "- The word must include the central letter.\n",
    "- The word cannot include any letter beyond the seven given letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that letters can be repeated. For example, the words GAME and AMALGAM are both acceptable words. Four-letter words are worth 1 point each, while five-letter words are worth 5 points, six-letter words are worth 6 points, seven-letter words are worth 7 points, etc. Words that use all of the seven letters in the honeycomb are known as “pangrams” and earn 7 bonus points (in addition to the points for the length of the word). So in the above example, MEGAPLEX is worth 15 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which seven-letter honeycomb results in the highest possible game score? To be a valid choice of seven letters, no letter can be repeated, it must not contain the letter S (that would be too easy) and there must be at least one pangram.\n",
    "\n",
    "For consistency, please use [this word list](https://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt) to check your game score.\n",

    "I used a brute-force approach. There are 3,364,900 different game boards and 44,585 eligible words. Solving this puzzle amounts to enumerating all possible words for each board and adding up their scores. In order to make this as efficient as possible, I used a few tricks:\n",
    "- I filtered the dictionary to exclude words shorter than 4 letters or that used more than 7 different letters, since these can never occur.\n",
    "- I pre-computed the scores of all remaining words in the dictionary\n",
    "- I created separate sub-dictionaries for each letter of the alphabet (all words that contain 'a', all words that contain 'b', etc.)\n",
    "- I used for loops that exit early when filtering the dictionary, which results in a 2x speed-up\n",
    "\n",
    "After all was said and done, the function I wrote took on average 5.22ms to compute the score of each board, which meant it took about 4 hours 53 min to solve the whole problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The winning board was \"RAEGINT\" (with R in the center), for a total score of 3898.\n",
    "This board yields a total of 537 words, 50 of which are pangrams.\n",
    "The highest-scoring words are REAGGREGATING and REINTEGRATING (20 points each).\n",
