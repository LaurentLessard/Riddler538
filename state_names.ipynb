    "Ohio is the only state whose name doesn’t share any letters with the word \"mackerel.\" It’s strange, but it’s true.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that isn’t the only pairing of a state and a word you can say that about — it’s not even the only fish! Kentucky has \"goldfish\" to itself, Montana has \"jellyfish\" and Delaware has \"monkfish,\" just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the longest \"mackerel?\" That is, what is the longest word that doesn’t share any letters with exactly one state? (If multiple \"mackerels\" are tied for being the longest, can you find them all?)\n",

    "### Solution approach\n",

    "Our approach will be one of brute force! Here is the process:\n",
    "1. For each word in the list, figure out which states don't share any letters with that word\n",
    "2. Keep all the words that have exactly one state associated with them. These are our \"mackerels\".\n",
    "3. Now we can answer the first question: what is the longest mackerel.\n",
    "4. Rearrange our data so that instead of having one state for each word, we have a list of words for each state.\n",
    "5. Now we can answer the extra credit question: which state has the most mackerels."
