    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by creating a partition of the alphabet, which determines which groups of letters are considered to be equivalent. For example, we could use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['ABCDEFG','HIJKLMNOP','QRSTUVWXYZ']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each letter maps to a group number `(A:1, K:2, X:3, etc)`. We can then map each English word to an integer. For example, `\"GRAPE\":13121`. If two words map to the same integer, then they are equivalent. We then start with our target word `\"YIRTHA\"` and see how many matches it has in the entire word list. The goal is to find a grouping that leads to a single match for the target word. The grouping should be thematic (based on the \"topology\" clue in the puzzle), and the word itself is also likely thematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most thematic grouping is to use topological homeomorphism, i.e. counting the number of \"holes\" that each letter contains. This leads to the grouping:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['CEFGHIJKLMNSTUVWXYZ', 'ADOPQR', 'B']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unfortunately, this leads to 301 matches. Likely because the grouping is so lopsided; most letters have no holes. So we need to refine our grouping a bit. I tried several others (see code below). The solution turns out to be to group letters based on number of holes _and_ number of \"dead ends\". For example, `A` and `R` are still equivalent (both have one hole and two dead ends), but `A` and `Q` are no longer equivalent, because `Q` only has one dead end. This leads us to the grouping:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['AR', 'B', 'CGIJLMNSUVWZ', 'DO', 'PQ', 'EFTY', 'HKX']\n",
    "```\n",
    "And this works! The match is `EUREKA`, which makes sense. Code is below"
